Be careful on how range acts on lists, test with len().
i in range(len(list))

Learn list operations correctly for exam.


Nested lists: similar to multidimensional arrays(2d onwards)

for item in twoDimlist:
	use item[i] as one list is temporarily copied into item

FILES:

open(filename,mode)
r w a

file.readline() - returns(prints) whole line and even \n at the end
		- returns empty string if EOF is encountered
file.close()
learn about end='' utility in python string printing

print(line_read,end='') -> removes blank line inbetween

file.read() -> entire file

file.readlines() -> prints all the lines in file even '\n'-----carefull \n is one line too

file.write(str) command writes to a file.


tkinter utility for gui file access:
import tkinter.filedialog
tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename() - opens a gui window to select file. (didnt try)

	"	asksaveasfilename()




Tuples:

immutable; (...,..,..,..)
single element tuple:eg: (1,)
empty tuple: eg: ()

Dictionary:
TYPE DICT
dict = {key :value,key :value..) to assign to lists
dict[key] returns value(key must be unique)

ERROR for keys that dont exsist(key error).
 
key in list ->returns boolean (works only on keys not values)
false for values as key is checked

len(dict) -> returns num keys

dict['key'] = value ->assignment ...........MUTABLE

del dict[key] -> remove key and value

for i in dict:
	i returns keys.
	can acess value using indices
key and values must be same for different elements of dict.


Inverting a dictionary:
--be careful--
